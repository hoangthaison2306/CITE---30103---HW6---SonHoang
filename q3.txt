Question 3 – Removing #include <stdio.h>

If #include <stdio.h> is removed from a program that uses printf(), the error occurs during the linking stage.

Explanation:
- Without stdio.h, the compiler does not know the function prototype of printf().
- The program may still compile with a warning, because C assumes printf() returns an int by default.
- However, during the linking stage, the linker cannot find the actual definition of printf() inside the standard C library.

Expected error message:
undefined reference to `printf`

Stage that fails:
Linking stage.

Conclusion:
Removing #include <stdio.h> causes a linker error because printf() is declared in stdio.h and linked from the C standard library.
